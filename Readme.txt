Hello,

To start out, please run the main.py. It will start out by asking for the absolute path of the test set.
One that is always valid is the [*Project folder*\Testset]. After that it will ask you if you want to train
the models again. This will take some time. If you do wish to train them, you need to input a valid training set.
The folder [*Project location*\en] is always valid. Remember that these need an absolute path.
When all the models are trained ( or if you skipped them) it will output values for Precision, recall and F-score for all three models.
