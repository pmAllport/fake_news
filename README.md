* Run main.py.
* Insert The absolute path of the test set. One that is always valid is [*Project folder*\Testset]

* If you chose to train the models, you will have to insert the absolute path to the valid training set. [*Project location*\en]  is always a valid set.
* When all the models are trained ( or if you skipped them) it will output values for Precision, recall and F-score for all three models.
